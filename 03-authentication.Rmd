GitHub requires a Personal Access Token (PAT) instead of passwords for Git operations.

## Preferred Method: R + RStudio

If you don't already have R and RStudio installed, it's very easy and highly recommended to install them:

- **R**: Download from [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- **RStudio**: Download from [https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

Both are free and install quickly on all major operating systems.

The easiest way to set up GitHub authentication is to run the following commands in R or RStudio:

```r
install.packages(c("usethis", "gitcreds"))
usethis::create_github_token()  # Opens browser to create PAT
gitcreds::gitcreds_set()        # Enter your PAT when prompted
```

When you run `usethis::create_github_token()`, it will open your browser to GitHub where you'll need to:

- Click "Generate new token (classic)"
- Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Academic Projects 2024")
- Set expiration (recommended: 90 days for learning, 1 year for regular use)
- Select scopes (the function pre-selects the right ones, but verify you have **repo**, **workflow**, and **user**)
- Click "Generate token"
- **Copy the token immediately** - you won't see it again! Store it in a password manager for safekeeping.

Then return to R/RStudio and run `gitcreds::gitcreds_set()` to enter your PAT when prompted.

That's it!

## Alternative: Git CLI + Credential Helper

If you do not want to install R and RStudio, you can create your PAT manually on GitHub:

Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic), then follow the same steps as described above (click "Generate new token (classic)", give it a name, set expiration, select scopes, generate and copy the token).

Then configure your credential helper:

**macOS:**
```bash
git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain
```

**Windows:**
```bash
git config --global credential.helper manager-core
```

When you clone or push, you'll be asked for:

- Username: your_github_username
- Password: your_PAT_here

✅ Git will remember the token after this — no need to reenter.


## Testing Your Setup

### Verify Git Configuration

```bash
git config --list
# Should show your name and email
```

### Test Authentication

Try cloning a repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

When prompted, enter:

- Username: your_github_username
- Password: your_PAT (not your account password!)

**Notes**:

1) If you used the R/RStudio method above, you might not be asked for credentials at all since they're already stored securely.
2) If using the credential helpers (explained above), Git will remember your token for future use.

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Failed

**Common issues:**

- Using account password instead of PAT
- Token has expired
- Insufficient token permissions
- Typo in username or token

**Solutions:**

1. Verify you're using the PAT, not your password
2. Check token expiration date
3. Ensure token has "repo" scope
4. Try clearing credentials and re-entering
