## Understanding Git Workflow

Before diving into commands, let's understand the basic Git workflow:

**Basic Workflow:**

1. **Modify** files in your working directory
2. **Stage** changes you want to include in next commit
3. **Commit** staged changes to repository
4. **Push** commits to GitHub

## Essential Git Commands

### 1. Starting a Repository

**Option A: Clone existing repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
cd repository-name
```

**Option B: Initialize new repository**
```bash
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
git init
```

### 2. Check Status

**Most important command - use frequently:**

```bash
git status
```

This shows:

- Which files are modified
- Which files are staged
- Which files are untracked

### 3. Stage Changes

**Stage specific files (rarely used):**
```bash
git add filename.txt
git add folder/
```

**Stage all changes (used almost always):**
```bash
git add .
```

### 4. Commit Changes

**Commit with message (used almost always):**
```bash
git commit -m "Add introduction chapter"
```

**Commit with detailed message (rarely used):**
```bash
git commit -m "Add introduction chapter

- Added overview of research methodology
- Included literature review section
- Fixed formatting issues in references"
```

### 5. View History

**See commit history:**
```bash
git log
```

**See compact history:**
```bash
git log --oneline
```

**See last 5 commits:**
```bash
git log --oneline -5
```

### 6. Synchronize with GitHub

**Push your changes to GitHub:**
```bash
git push
```

**Pull latest changes from GitHub:**
```bash
git pull
```

### 7. Undo Changes

**⚠️ WARNING: These commands are for experienced users only!** If you're new to Git, please consult a more experienced Git user before venturing into this jungle. These commands can permanently delete your work if used incorrectly.

**Unstage files:**
```bash
git reset filename.txt
```

**Discard changes in working directory:**
```bash
git checkout -- filename.txt
```

**Undo last commit (keep changes):**
```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

**⚠️ Dangerous: Undo last commit and discard changes:**
```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

## Daily Research Workflow

```bash
# Start your day
git status                    # Check current state
git pull                     # Get latest changes

# Work on your files
# ... edit files ...

# Save your work
git add .                    # Stage all changes
git status                   # Review what you're committing
git commit -m "Update analysis results"
git push                     # Share your changes
```
