Before we dive into installation and setup, let's understand what GitHub is:

**GitHub** is a web-based platform that uses **Git** for version control. Think of it as:

- **A cloud-based code repository** with version tracking and collaboration features
- **A social network for developers and researchers** 
- **A backup system** that keeps track of every change you make
- **A collaboration tool** that lets multiple people work on the same project

**Git vs. GitHub:**

- **Git** = A version control system (software) invented by Finnish Linus Torvalds in 2005
- **GitHub** = The online platform that hosts Git repositories
